  status: 'active' | 'inactive' | 'muted';

}
```

    }
  ]
}
```

**Status:** ✅ CORRECT

---

### **4. Moderation Actions - ✅ ALL PRESENT**

**UI Actions Found:**
- ✅ PUT `/groups/:groupId/members/:memberId/role` - Make/remove moderator
- ✅ POST `/groups/:groupId/members/:memberId/mute` - Mute member
- ✅ POST `/groups/:groupId/members/:memberId/unmute` - Unmute member
- ✅ DELETE `/groups/:groupId/members/:memberId` - Remove member
- ✅ DELETE `/groups/:groupId/messages/:messageId` - Delete message
- ✅ POST `/groups/:groupId/announcements` - Send announcements

**All endpoints documented:** ✅ YES

## 🔗 THERAPIST vs CLIENT CONNECTION

### **Group Size/Limits:**

**Therapist Side (Creator):**
```json
POST /api/v1/th/groups
{
  "maxMembers": 20  // ✅ Therapist sets the limit
}
```

**Client Side (Consumer):**
```json
GET /api/v1/client/groups
{
  "myGroups": {
    "count": 3,      // ✅ How many groups client joined
    "limit": 4,      // ✅ Plan-based limit (Basic:3, Premium:4)
    "plan": "premium"
  }
}
```

**Philosophy Applied:**
- ✅ Therapist: Sets `maxMembers` per group (group capacity)
- ✅ Client: Has `limit` based on subscription plan (how many groups they can join)
- ✅ Two different limits for different purposes

**Example:**
- Therapist creates group with `maxMembers: 20` (group can hold 20 people)
- Client on Basic plan has `limit: 3` (can only join 3 groups total)
- Client tries to join 4th group → blocked by plan limit
- Group with 20/20 members → new clients can't join (group full)

---

## ✅ SUMMARY

### **Therapist Endpoints: ALL CORRECT**

1. ✅ Group creation with `maxMembers` setting
2. ✅ Member attendance tracking
3. ✅ Member status management (active/inactive/muted)
4. ✅ Role management (member/moderator)
5. ✅ Moderation tools (mute, remove, delete messages)
6. ✅ Announcements
7. ✅ Group statistics

### **Client Endpoints: NEEDS UPDATE**

1. ⚠️ GET `/client/groups` - Add `myGroups{count, limit, plan}`
2. ⚠️ POST `/client/groups/:groupId/join` - Add membership limit error
3. ⚠️ POST `/client/groups/:groupId/leave` - Missing endpoint

---

## 🎯 PHILOSOPHY CHECK: ✅ MAINTAINED

**Therapist (Creator/Manager):**
- ✅ Creates groups
- ✅ Sets group capacity (`maxMembers`)
- ✅ Manages members
- ✅ Moderates content
- ✅ Tracks attendance
- ✅ Sends announcements
- ✅ Full control

**Client (Consumer/Participant):**
- ✅ Browses groups
- ✅ Joins groups (limited by plan)
- ✅ Participates in chat
- ✅ Leaves groups
- ✅ Limited by subscription tier
- ✅ No creation/management powers

**Connection:**
- ✅ Therapist's `maxMembers` = group capacity
- ✅ Client's `limit` = subscription-based join limit
- ✅ Both limits enforced independently
- ✅ Philosophy: Therapists control content, Clients consume within plan limits

---

## ✅ FINAL STATUS

**Therapist Endpoints:** ✅ ALL CORRECT  
**Client Endpoints:** ⚠️ 3 MINOR UPDATES NEEDED (already documented)

**Philosophy:** ✅ PROPERLY MAINTAINED

---

**No additional issues found in therapist endpoints. The group size/limit system is correctly designed with therapist-set capacity and client plan-based limits!** 🎯
