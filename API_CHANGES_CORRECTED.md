# API Endpoints Changes - CORRECTED

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### **1. Mood System Changes** 
You were RIGHT - the mood system changed significantly!

#### **What Changed:**
- **MVP Approach:** Streak-based milestones, NOT daily points
- **Points:** Only awarded at 7, 14, and 30-day streaks
- **Daily Check-ins:** No points earned (pointsEarned: 0)

#### **Endpoint Changes Made:**

##### **GET `/api/v1/client/mood/history`**
```json
"stats": {
  "currentStreak": 7,
  "totalPoints": 0,  // CHANGED: Points only at milestones
  "totalCheckIns": 45,
  "milestonesReached": 1,  // ADDED: Track progress (0-3)
  "nextMilestone": 14  // ADDED: Next reward at 14 days
}
```

##### **GET `/api/v1/client/mood/today`**
```json
"stats": {
  "currentStreak": 7,
  "totalPoints": 0,  // CHANGED: No daily points
  "milestonesReached": 1,  // ADDED: 1 of 3 milestones
  "nextMilestone": 14  // ADDED: Next reward
}
```

##### **POST `/api/v1/client/mood`** (Log mood)
```json
"data": {
  "pointsEarned": 0,  // CHANGED: No daily points
  "currentStreak": 8,
  "totalPoints": 0,  // CHANGED: Only milestone points
  "isMilestone": false,  // ADDED: True at 7/14/30 days
  "nextMilestone": 14,  // ADDED: Days to next reward
  "milestonesReached": 1  // ADDED: Progress (0-3)
}
```

##### **GET `/api/v1/client/mood/points`** â†’ **RENAMED**
**New:** `GET /api/v1/client/mood/milestones`

```json
{
  "currentStreak": 7,
  "milestonesReached": 1,
  "totalPoints": 500,  // Only from 7-day milestone
  "milestones": [
    {
      "days": 7,
      "reward": 500,
      "reached": true,
      "reachedDate": "2025-10-23"
    },
    {
      "days": 14,
      "reward": 1000,
      "reached": false,
      "daysRemaining": 7
    },
    {
      "days": 30,
      "reward": 2000,
      "reached": false,
      "daysRemaining": 23
    }
  ],
  "nextMilestone": {
    "days": 14,
    "reward": 1000,
    "daysRemaining": 7
  }
}
```

### **2. Wastecoin Removed**
You were RIGHT - wastecoin was dummy content!

#### **What Was Removed:**
- `wastecoinBalanceVisibility` from all endpoints
- All wastecoin references

#### **Privacy Settings - CORRECTED:**
```json
{
  "privacy": {
    "walletBalanceVisibility": true
    // REMOVED: wastecoinBalanceVisibility (not used)
  }
}
```

## ðŸ“Š Complete Mood System Changes

### **New Fields Added:**
1. `milestonesReached` - Number of milestones completed (0-3)
2. `nextMilestone` - Days until next reward (7, 14, or 30)
3. `isMilestone` - Boolean, true when streak hits milestone
4. `milestones[]` - Array of milestone progress

### **Changed Fields:**
1. `pointsEarned` - Always 0 for daily check-ins (only at milestones)
2. `totalPoints` - Only accumulates at 7, 14, 30 days

### **Milestone Rewards:**
- **7 days:** 500 points
- **14 days:** 1000 points
- **30 days:** 2000 points

## ðŸ”„ Backend Implementation Guide

### **Mood Check-in Logic:**
```javascript
// When user logs mood
if (currentStreak + 1 === 7 || currentStreak + 1 === 14 || currentStreak + 1 === 30) {
  // Milestone reached!
  const reward = currentStreak + 1 === 7 ? 500 : currentStreak + 1 === 14 ? 1000 : 2000;
  
  return {
    pointsEarned: reward,
    isMilestone: true,
    milestonesReached: calculateMilestones(currentStreak + 1),
    totalPoints: userTotalPoints + reward
  };
} else {
  // Regular check-in
  return {
    pointsEarned: 0,
    isMilestone: false,
    milestonesReached: calculateMilestones(currentStreak + 1),
    nextMilestone: getNextMilestone(currentStreak + 1)
  };
}
```

### **Calculate Milestones:**
```javascript
function calculateMilestones(streak) {
  let count = 0;
  if (streak >= 7) count++;
  if (streak >= 14) count++;
  if (streak >= 30) count++;
  return count;
}

function getNextMilestone(streak) {
  if (streak < 7) return 7;
  if (streak < 14) return 14;
  if (streak < 30) return 30;
  return null; // All milestones reached
}
```

## ðŸ“‹ Summary of ALL Changes

### **Mood Endpoints (5 changes):**
1. âœ… GET /mood/history - Added milestone fields
2. âœ… GET /mood/today - Added milestone fields
3. âœ… POST /mood - Changed to milestone-based points
4. âœ… GET /mood/points â†’ RENAMED to /mood/milestones
5. âœ… All pointsEarned set to 0 for daily check-ins

### **Settings Endpoints (1 change):**
1. âœ… Removed wastecoinBalanceVisibility from all responses

---

## âœ… Corrected Changelog

**What Actually Changed:**
1. **Mood System:** Daily points â†’ Milestone rewards (7, 14, 30 days)
2. **New Endpoint:** GET /mood/milestones (renamed from /points)
3. **New Fields:** milestonesReached, nextMilestone, isMilestone
4. **Removed:** wastecoinBalanceVisibility (dummy content)

**Impact:**
- Backend must track streaks and award points only at milestones
- Frontend already implements this (MVP_MOOD_CHECKIN_AUDIT.md)
- Points system deferred until milestone achievements
