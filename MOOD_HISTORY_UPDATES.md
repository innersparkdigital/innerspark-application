# Mood History Screen Updates

## Changes Completed ‚úÖ

### 1. **Removed Points Display**
- ‚ùå Removed "+500 pts" badge from Recent Entries list items
- ‚úÖ Set `pointsEarned: 0` in mock data (MVP: Points deferred)
- ‚úÖ Hidden points display section with comment `{/* MVP: Points hidden */}`

### 2. **Enhanced Mood Trend Chart**
The chart was already implemented but has been improved for better visibility:

**Chart Features:**
- **Line chart** showing mood trends over selected period (7, 30, or 90 days)
- **Y-axis**: Emoji mood indicators (üò¢ üòî üòê üôÇ üòä)
- **X-axis**: Date labels for each entry
- **Data points**: Colored circles (12px) with shadows for better visibility
- **Connecting lines**: 3px thick lines with 60% opacity connecting mood points
- **Color coding**: Each mood level has its own color
  - Terrible (1): Red `#F44336`
  - Bad (2): Orange `#FF9800`
  - Okay (3): Yellow `#FFC107`
  - Good (4): Light Green `#8BC34A`
  - Great (5): Green `#4CAF50`
- **Interactive**: Tap any data point to see full details (date, mood, note)
- **Horizontal scroll**: Chart scrolls horizontally for longer periods
- **Grid lines**: Subtle grid lines for each mood level
- **Empty state**: Shows helpful message when no data exists

**Chart Improvements:**
- Larger data points (12px vs 8px) for better visibility
- Thicker connecting lines (3px vs 2px)
- Added shadows to data points for depth
- Dynamic title showing selected period: "Mood Trend - Last X Days"
- Better spacing between data points (50px vs 40px)
- Empty state with icon and helpful text

### 3. **Chart Display Logic**
```typescript
if (moodHistory.length === 0) {
  // Show empty state with icon and message
  return (
    <View style={styles.emptyChart}>
      <Icon name="show-chart" />
      <Text>No mood data yet</Text>
      <Text>Start tracking your mood to see trends</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

// Otherwise show full interactive chart
```

### 4. **Period Filters**
Users can switch between:
- **7 Days** - Weekly view
- **30 Days** - Monthly view
- **90 Days** - Quarterly view

Chart automatically adjusts to show selected period.

## Chart Implementation Details

### **Chart Type: Line Chart**
- **Why line chart?** Best for showing mood trends over time
- Shows continuous emotional journey
- Easy to spot patterns and fluctuations
- Color-coded for quick mood identification

### **Alternative Considered: Bar Chart**
- Could show mood frequency distribution
- Better for comparing mood counts
- Less effective for showing trends over time
- **Decision:** Line chart is better for primary use case (tracking emotional journey)

### **Future Enhancement Ideas:**
1. **Mood Distribution Chart** (Pie/Donut)
   - Show percentage breakdown of each mood
   - "You felt Great 40% of the time this month"
   
2. **Weekly Average Bar Chart**
   - Compare average mood across weeks
   - Identify best/worst weeks

3. **Heatmap Calendar**
   - GitHub-style contribution calendar
   - Quick visual of check-in consistency
