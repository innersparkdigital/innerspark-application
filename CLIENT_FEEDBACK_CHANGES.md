### 2. **Therapists Screen - Donate Button Enhanced**

**File:** `src/screens/TherapistsScreen.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ **Added "Donate" text label** next to heart icon
- ‚úÖ **Improved button styling** for better visibility
  - Now shows: ‚ù§Ô∏è Donate
  - Flexbox layout with gap between icon and text
  - Increased padding for better touch target
  - Semi-transparent white background on blue header

**Strategic Placement:**
- **Current Location:** Top right of header (when not showing back button)
- **Visibility:** Always visible on main Therapists screen
- **Context:** Perfect placement - users browsing therapists can easily donate

**Other Strategic Locations to Consider:**
1. ‚úÖ Therapists Screen (current - DONE)
2. Therapist Detail Screen (when viewing individual therapist)
3. Home Screen (as quick action or header button)
4. After successful appointment booking (gratitude moment)
5. Profile/Account screen (under "Support" section)

### 3. **Panic Button Modal - Responsive Width Fix**

**File:** `src/components/PanicButtonComponent.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ **Made modal width responsive** using percentage-based sizing
- ‚úÖ **Fixed button overflow** on small screens
- ‚úÖ **Uniform appearance** across all device sizes

**Technical Changes:**
- `modalContent`: Now uses `Math.min(width * 0.85, 380)` - scales with screen, max 380px
- `actionsCircle`: Changed from fixed `300px` to `80%` width with `maxWidth: 300`
- `actionButton`: Changed from fixed `90px` to `width * 0.22` (22% of screen) with `maxWidth: 90`
- Added `padding: 20` to modalContent for internal spacing

**Responsive Behavior:**
- **Small screens (< 320px):** Modal scales down proportionally, buttons stay inside
- **Medium screens (320-450px):** Optimal size, buttons well-positioned
- **Large screens (> 450px):** Capped at 380px max width for consistency

**Before:**
```
Fixed widths: 
- Modal: width * 0.85 (could be too large)
- Circle: 300px (fixed)
- Buttons: 90px (fixed)
Result: Buttons could overflow on small screens
```

**After:**
```
Responsive widths:
- Modal: min(width * 0.85, 380px)
- Circle: 80% with max 300px
- Buttons: 22% of screen with max 90px
Result: Perfect fit on all screen sizes
```
