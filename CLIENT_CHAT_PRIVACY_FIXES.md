## 🚀 Next Steps (When Backend is Ready)

### **API Integration Needed:**

1. **Conversations Endpoint:**
   ```
   GET /api/v1/client/conversations
   - Returns only therapist conversations
   - Filters out peer-to-peer chats
   ```

2. **Therapist List Endpoint:**
   ```
   GET /api/v1/therapists
   - Returns available therapists
   - Includes specialty, availability
   ```

3. **Group Messages Endpoint:**
   ```
   GET /api/v1/groups/:groupId/messages
   - Anonymizes non-therapist sender names
   - Returns "Group Member" for privacy
   ```

4. **Group Membership Endpoint:**
   ```
   GET /api/v1/groups/:groupId/members
   - Returns member count only (no names)
   - Therapists get full member list
   ```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### **Pre-existing Lint Errors:**
The following lint errors exist in the original chat screens (NOT caused by our changes):
- Avatar `backgroundColor` prop (RNEUI version issue)
- `appFonts.regularText` property (should be `bodyTextRegular`)

These are cosmetic TypeScript errors that don't affect functionality. They exist in multiple screens throughout the app.

### **Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Verify clients cannot see user contacts
- [ ] Verify group members are anonymous
- [ ] Verify therapist messages show real names
- [ ] Verify no moderation tools visible to clients
- [ ] Verify navigation to ClientGroupChatScreen works
- [ ] Verify privacy notice displays in groups
