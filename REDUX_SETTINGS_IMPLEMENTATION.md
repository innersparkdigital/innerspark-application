# Redux Store & Appearance Settings Implementation

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. **Mood Redux Slice - Aligned** ‚úÖ
**File:** `src/features/mood/moodSlice.js`

**Status:** Properly documented and aligned with MVP approach

**Changes:**
- Updated comments to reflect MVP streak-based system
- Documented that points are deferred until milestones (7, 14, 30 days)
- Clarified `addPoints` action is called only at milestones
- All state structure intact for future milestone rewards

**State Structure:**
```javascript
{
  hasCheckedInToday: false,
  todayMoodData: null,
  currentStreak: 0,
  totalPoints: 0,  // Accumulates at milestones only
  totalCheckIns: 0,
  moodHistory: [],
  isLoading: false,
  isSubmitting: false,
  error: null,
  lastUpdated: null,
}
```

  useSystemTheme: false,
  
  // Accessibility settings (NEW)
  highContrast: false,
  reducedMotion: false,

- `selectHighContrast(state)` - Get high contrast status
- `selectReducedMotion(state)` - Get reduced motion status
- `selectLargeText(state)` - Get large text status

### 3. **Redux Store - Updated** ‚úÖ
**File:** `src/app/store.js`

**Changes:**
- Registered `userSettings` reducer
- Added import for `userSettingsReducer`
- Properly documented in store configuration

**Store Structure:**
```javascript
{
  user: userReducer,
  userData: userDataReducer,
  signupFlow: signupFlowReducer,
  appSession: appSessionReducer,
  appStart: appStartReducer,
  mood: moodReducer,
  subscription: subscriptionReducer,
  userSettings: userSettingsReducer,  // ‚úÖ NEW
  therapistDashboard: therapistDashboardReducer,
  therapistAppointments: therapistAppointmentsReducer,
  therapistClients: therapistClientsReducer,
  therapistRequests: therapistRequestsReducer,
  therapistGroups: therapistGroupsReducer,
  therapistAnalytics: therapistAnalyticsReducer,
}
```

### 4. **Appearance Settings Screen - Connected** ‚úÖ
**File:** `src/screens/settingScreens/AppearanceSettingsScreen.tsx`

**Status:** Fully functional and connected to Redux

**Features Implemented:**

#### **Theme Selection:**
- ‚úÖ Light Mode - Bright and clear interface
- ‚úÖ Dark Mode - Easy on the eyes at night

- ‚úÖ Listens to system theme changes in real-time
- ‚úÖ Shows toast notifications on theme changes

#### **Accessibility:**
- ‚úÖ High Contrast - Increase contrast for better visibility

## üéØ HOW IT WORKS

### **User Flow:**
1. User opens Settings ‚Üí Appearance
2. Screen loads current settings from Redux
3. User changes theme/accessibility option
4. Action dispatched to Redux
5. Redux updates state
6. Screen re-renders with new values
7. Settings persist across app sessions

### **System Theme Integration:**
```typescript
// When "Use System Theme" is enabled:
1. Sets theme to 'auto' in Redux
2. Listens to Appearance.addChangeListener()
3. Shows toast when system theme changes
4. App can read current system theme with Appearance.getColorScheme()
```

### **State Persistence:**
```typescript
// Redux state is persisted (if redux-persist is configured)
// Settings survive:
- App restarts
- Device reboots
- App updates
```
